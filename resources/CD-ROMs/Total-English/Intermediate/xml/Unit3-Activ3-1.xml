I just want to check a few final details. Firstly, when you arrive, wait outside the station. Our driver <Gap>will probably be</Gap>there to collect you, but he <Gap>might not</Gap>arrive until 5.30p.m. We've got a meeting in the afternoon and it <Gap>may not finish</Gap>on time. I'm sorry that I can't guarantee that I'll be there to meet you, especially as there <Gap>could </Gap>be a lot of traffic at that time.<br></br>We<Gap>'ll probably work</Gap>mostly from the office, so you<Gap>won't need</Gap>your laptop. However, you <Gap>might want</Gap>copies of any important files you have. Also, we<Gap>may have</Gap>the chance to visit one of the factories, and the weather <Gap>could be very</Gap>cold, so bring a warm coat and a hat!<br></br>Lastly, you <Gap>probably won't</Gap>need very much money, but you could change some at the airport, just to be sure.<br></br>See you on Monday.<br></br>Regards,<br></br>Jim </ContentGapFillDragDrop></GapFillDragDrop></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
