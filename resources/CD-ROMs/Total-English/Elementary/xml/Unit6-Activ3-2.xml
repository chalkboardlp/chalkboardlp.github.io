We didn't <Gap>own</Gap>a big house - in fact it was very small. I <Gap>didn't have</Gap>a bedroom just for me - my two big sisters and I lived in the same room. I <Gap>didn't like</Gap>that - it was horrible. My father was always ill and he <Gap>didn't work</Gap>a lot - he never stayed in a job for long because he <Gap>didn't go</Gap>into the office when he was ill. My mother worked for a few hours every week in a small shop, but she <Gap>didn't make</Gap>much money from that. Some people say that money doesn't bring happiness, but my family <Gap>wasn't</Gap>happy. When I was 18, I <Gap>didn't want</Gap>to stay with my family any more, so I decided to move out.</ContentGapFillDragDrop></GapFillDragDrop></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
