At a meeting last night, Mrs Alicia Galton, Mayor of Denbury, announced her <Gap>intentions</Gap>for the next three years. The town <Gap>is going to</Gap>spend over 10 million pounds on new projects. The first is a new shopping centre in the suburbs. It is going <Gap>to have</Gap>more than 30 different shops and parking spaces for 200 cars. '<Gap>It's</Gap>going to be the best shopping centre in the area', said the Mayor, 'and we're going to <Gap>build</Gap>a new gym and swimming pool next to the shopping centre.' The Mayor also talked about projects for the centre of town. There is <Gap>going to be</Gap>a new museum in the old shoe factory, and a new library is going <Gap>to open</Gap>near the bus station. 'We want people to enjoy the history and culture of our town,' said Mrs Galton,' So <Gap>we're going</Gap>to have a local history section in the new museum, and we're going to <Gap>show</Gap>lots of photos of the old town.'</ContentGapFillDragDrop></GapFillDragDrop></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
